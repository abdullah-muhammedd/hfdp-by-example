# Head First Design Patterns ‚Äì By Example (A real one)

## üìñ Introduction

This repository documents my personal journey through **Head First Design Patterns (HFDP)**.

Instead of sticking to the classic, simplified examples from the book, I intentionally **ignore them entirely** and replace them with **real-world problems**‚Äîthings I‚Äôve actually faced in my work or was curious to explore.

The goal isn‚Äôt to ‚Äúovercomplicate‚Äù for its own sake, but to:

* **Understand each pattern deeply** by applying it where design decisions genuinely matter.
* **Build realistic, maintainable examples** that could exist in production-grade systems.
* **Bridge the gap between theory and practice**, turning abstract design concepts into concrete, working code.

Every chapter demonstrates:

* The **core idea** of the pattern.
* A **practical use case** that justifies its existence.
* How the pattern fits into **real backend engineering problems**, not toy simulations.




## My HFDP Pattern Implementations ‚Äì Real‚ÄëWorld Case Studies

| Pattern Name                  | Directory                        | Implementation Idea                                                                                                                                    | Definition (from HFDP)                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strategy Pattern              | `1-strategy-pattern/`            | Payment processing system with pluggable providers (Stripe, Paymob) allowing runtime switching.                                                                   | Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.                                                                                                      |
| Observer Pattern              | `2-observer-pattern/`            | Event monitoring system where multiple notification channels (Email, SMS, Logging) subscribe to and receive updates about system events.                          | Defines a one‚Äëto‚Äëmany dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated.                                                                        |
| Decorator Pattern             | `3-decorator-pattern/`           | Notification system where behaviors like logging, rate‚Äëlimiting, and retry can be dynamically added to providers without modifying their core implementation.     | Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing.                                                                              |
| Factory Method Pattern        | `4-factory-method-pattern/`      | User management system where different user types (Admin, Owner, Viewer) are created via specialized factories under a common creation interface.                 | Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.                                                                                         |
| Abstract Factory Pattern      | `5-abstract-factory-pattern/`    | Job management system where families of related components (processors, runners, serializers) for RabbitMQ or BullMQ are created by concrete factories.           | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.                                                                      |
| Command Pattern               | `7-command-pattern/`             | E‚Äëcommerce cart system where add/change/remove actions are encapsulated as command objects, enabling undo/redo and decoupling controllers from business logic.    | Encapsulates a request as an object, letting you parameterize clients with requests, queue or log them, and support undo.                                                                   |
| Adapter Pattern               | `8-adapter-pattern/`             | Report generation system adapting a new PDF provider (v2) to an existing DOCX interface (v1) without changing client code‚Äîenabling backward compatibility.        | Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, allowing incompatible classes to work together.                                                                    |
| Facade Pattern                | `9-facade-pattern/`              | Centralized observation & reporting API (`ObservationFacade`) that coordinates logging, notifications, events, reports, and audits behind a single interface.     | Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.                                                                                                |
| Template Method Pattern       | `10-template-method-pattern/`    | ETL pipeline where an abstract `FileETLJob` defines the extract‚Üítransform‚Üíclean‚Üíload workflow and subclasses (`CsvETLJob`, `ExcelETLJob`) implement extraction.   | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.                                                                                                       |
| Composite & Iterator Patterns | `11-composite-iterator-pattern/` | ETL pipeline composed of `Executable` jobs, with `PipelineJob` as a composite and depth‚Äëfirst iteration to execute each job uniformly.                            | **Composite:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part‚Äëwhole hierarchies. **Iterator:** Provides a way to access elements sequentially without exposing the representation. |
| State Pattern                 | `12-state-pattern/`              | Webhook lifecycle manager where each state (Idle, Verifying, Processing, Completed, Error) encapsulates its own behavior and transitions.                         | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes; the object appears to change its class.                                                                             |
| Proxy Pattern                 | `13-proxy-pattern/`              | Video processing API combining **Protection Proxy** (API key & quota enforcement), **Virtual Proxy** (lazy user & API key creation), and **Remote Proxy** (HTTP). | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it, add behavior, or delay its creation.                                                                        |

# Principles learned from the book

| Principle                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)                 | A class (or module) should have one, and only one, reason to change‚Äîi.e., it should have only one responsibility or job.                                             |
| Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)                         | Favor simplicity by avoiding unnecessary complexity. Simple designs are easier to understand, test, and maintain.                                                    |
| Hollywood Principle (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call us, we‚Äôll call you‚Äù) | Design to **inversion of control**: lower‚Äëlevel components register or plug into higher‚Äëlevel frameworks, which drive the flow rather than hard‚Äëcoding direct calls. |
| Identify what varies and encapsulate it               | Find the parts of your application that change and separate them into their own classes or modules so changes don‚Äôt ripple through unrelated code.                   |
| Program to an interface, not an implementation        | Depend on abstract interfaces or base classes instead of concrete classes, enabling polymorphism and reducing coupling between clients and implementations.          |
| Strive for loosely coupled designs                    | Minimize direct dependencies by using interfaces, delegates, or design patterns so objects can be modified or replaced without impacting each other.                 |
| Open‚ÄìClosed Principle                                 | Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification‚Äînew behavior gets added by extending, not by altering tested, existing code.                        |
| Favor object composition over class inheritance       | Build complex behavior by combining simple objects at runtime rather than imposing behavior through rigid inheritance hierarchies.                                   |
| Dependency Inversion Principle                        | Depend upon abstractions, not concretions: both high‚Äë and low‚Äëlevel modules should rely on shared interfaces, not on each other‚Äôs concrete implementations.          |
| Encapsulate what varies                               | Wherever variation occurs‚Äîalgorithms, formats, protocols‚Äîwrap it behind an interface so changes stay localized.                                                      |
| Keep objects loosely coupled                          | Use indirection (e.g., proxies, adapters) and well‚Äëdefined interfaces to avoid tight binding between classes and promote independent evolution.                      |

## Final Thoughts

I‚Äôll be honest‚Äîbuilding out all these real‚Äëworld examples took a ton of time and effort on top of juggling my full‚Äëtime jobs. But it was absolutely worth it. Along the way I:

* Deepened my understanding of each pattern by solving problems I actually care about.
* Learned new tools and techniques (NestJS, FFmpeg, Prisma, streaming I/O, and more).
* Put these designs to use at work, where colleagues now rely on my clear diagrams and modular architectures.

Above all, I had fun. Every ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment‚Äîwiring up a virtual proxy, crafting a clean facade, or watching a command pattern undo itself‚Äîreinforced why good design matters. I hope you find these examples as useful (and enjoyable) as I did, whether you‚Äôre learning patterns for the first time or applying them on the job.

Happy coding!
